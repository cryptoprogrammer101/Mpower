        <p>Alcohol and drug abuse can increase the underlying risk for mental disorders. Since mental health
            problems are caused by a complex interplay of genetics, the environment, and other factors, it's
            difficult to say if abusing substances ever directly causes them. However, if you are at risk for a
            mental health issue, abusing alcohol or drugs may push you over the edge. For example, there is some
            evidence that those who abuse opioid painkillers are at greater risk for depression and heavy cannabis
            use has been linked to an increased risk for schizophrenia.
