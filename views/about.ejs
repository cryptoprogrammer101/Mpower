      <h1 class="big-heading">Mpower: Path to Recovery</h1>

      <p>

        Mpower was founded by Narayan Sajeev, a senior at Nashua High School South, to address the high rates of drug
        abuse among youth in New Hampshire. Driven by the personal impact of the drug epidemic, Narayan established
        Mpower to offer support to those affected by drug abuse.

        <br><br>

        The name Mpower embodies Narayan's conviction that empowering oneself to take control of thoughts & emotions
        is the first step towards lasting recovery. If you or someone you know is struggling with drug abuse, don't
        hesitate to <a href="contact">contact Mpower</a> for more information & support.
