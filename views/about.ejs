      <h1 class="big-heading">Mpower: Path to Recovery</h1>

      <p>

        Mpower was founded by Narayan Sajeev, a senior at Nashua High School South, in response to the high rates of
        drug abuse among youth in New Hampshire. Motivated by the personal impact of the drug epidemic, Narayan created Mpower to
        provide support to individuals and families affected by drug abuse.

        <br><br>

        The name Mpower reflects Narayan's belief that the first step towards lasting recovery is empowering oneself to
        take control of thoughts and emotions. If you or a loved one is struggling with drug abuse, don't hesitate to
        <a href="contact">contact Mpower</a> for more information and support.
