        <p class="blurb">

            Substance abuse among teens has significantly increased, with drug overdose deaths doubling from 2019 to
            2020 and over two-thirds of high school seniors trying alcohol.

            <br><br>

            This behavior can lead to problems at
            school, mental health issues, motor-vehicle accidents, and place stress on families.
