        Alcohol and drug abuse can increase the underlying risk for mental disorders. Since mental health
        problems are caused by a complex interplay of genetics, the environment, and other factors, it's
        difficult to say if abusing drugs ever directly causes them. However, if you are at risk for a
        mental health issue, abusing alcohol or drugs may push you over the edge. For example, there is some
        evidence that those who abuse opioid painkillers are at greater risk for depression and heavy cannabis
        use has been linked to an increased risk for schizophrenia.
