    <p>

        Signs that someone has a drug problem include:

        Changing friends a lot
        Spending a lot of time alone
        Losing interest in favorite things
        Not taking care of themselves - for example, not taking showers, changing clothes, or brushing their teeth
        Being really tired and sad
        Eating more or eating less than usual
        Being very energetic, talking fast, or saying things that don't make sense
        Being in a bad mood
        Quickly changing between feeling bad and feeling good
        Sleeping at strange hours
        Missing important appointments
        Having problems at work or at school
        Having problems in personal or family relationships

        Drug addiction symptoms or behaviors include, among others:

        Feeling that you have to use the drug regularly — daily or even several times a day
        Having intense urges for the drug that block out any other thoughts
        Over time, needing more of the drug to get the same effect
        Taking larger amounts of the drug over a longer period of time than you intended
        Making certain that you maintain a supply of the drug
        Spending money on the drug, even though you can't afford it
        Not meeting obligations and work responsibilities, or cutting back on social or recreational activities because
        of drug use
        Continuing to use the drug, even though you know it's causing problems in your life or causing you physical or
        psychological harm
        Doing things to get the drug that you normally wouldn't do, such as stealing
        Driving or doing other risky activities when you're under the influence of the drug
        Spending a good deal of time getting the drug, using the drug or recovering from the effects of the drug
        Failing in your attempts to stop using the drug
        Experiencing withdrawal symptoms when you attempt to stop taking the drug
        Recognizing unhealthy drug use in family members

        Sometimes it's difficult to distinguish normal teenage moodiness or anxiety from signs of drug use. Possible
        signs that your teenager or other family member is using drugs include:

        Problems at school or work — frequently missing school or work, a sudden disinterest in school activities or
        work, or a drop in grades or work performance
        Physical health issues — lack of energy and motivation, weight loss or gain, or red eyes
        Neglected appearance — lack of interest in clothing, grooming or looks
        Changes in behavior — major efforts to bar family members from entering the teenager's room or being secretive
        about going out with friends; or drastic changes in behavior and in relationships with family and friends
        Money issues — sudden requests for money without a reasonable explanation; or your discovery that money is
        missing or has been stolen or that items have disappeared from your home, indicating maybe they're being sold to
        support drug use
        Recognizing signs of drug use or intoxication

        Signs and symptoms of drug use or intoxication may vary, depending on the type of drug. Below you'll find
        several examples.

        Marijuana, hashish and other cannabis-containing substances

        People use cannabis by smoking, eating or inhaling a vaporized form of the drug. Cannabis often precedes or is
        used along with other substances, such as alcohol or illegal drugs, and is often the first drug tried.

        Signs and symptoms of recent use can include:

        A sense of euphoria or feeling "high"
        A heightened sense of visual, auditory and taste perception
        Increased blood pressure and heart rate
        Red eyes
        Dry mouth
        Decreased coordination
        Difficulty concentrating or remembering
        Slowed reaction time
        Anxiety or paranoid thinking
        Cannabis odor on clothes or yellow fingertips
        Major cravings for certain foods at unusual times
        Long-term use is often associated with:

        Decreased mental sharpness
        Poor performance at school or at work
        Ongoing cough and frequent lung infections
        K2, Spice and bath salts

        Two groups of synthetic drugs — synthetic cannabinoids and substituted or synthetic cathinones — are illegal in
        most states. The effects of these drugs can be dangerous and unpredictable, as there is no quality control and
        some ingredients may not be known.

        Synthetic cannabinoids, also called K2 or Spice, are sprayed on dried herbs and then smoked, but can be prepared
        as an herbal tea. A liquid form can be vaporized in electronic cigarettes. Despite manufacturer claims, these
        are chemical compounds rather than "natural" or harmless products. These drugs can produce a "high" similar to
        marijuana and have become a popular but dangerous alternative.

        Signs and symptoms of recent use can include:

        A sense of euphoria or feeling "high"
        Elevated mood
        An altered sense of visual, auditory and taste perception
        Extreme anxiety or agitation
        Paranoia
        Hallucinations
        Increased heart rate and blood pressure or heart attack
        Vomiting
        Confusion
        Violent behavior
        Substituted cathinones, also called "bath salts," are mind-altering (psychoactive) substances similar to
        amphetamines such as ecstasy (MDMA) and cocaine. Packages are often labeled as other products to avoid
        detection.

        Despite the name, these are not bath products such as Epsom salts. Substituted cathinones can be eaten, snorted,
        inhaled or injected and are highly addictive. These drugs can cause severe intoxication, which results in
        dangerous health effects or even death.

        Signs and symptoms of recent use can include:

        Feeling "high"
        Increased sociability
        Increased energy and agitation
        Increased sex drive
        Increased heart rate and blood pressure
        Problems thinking clearly
        Loss of muscle control
        Paranoia
        Panic attacks
        Hallucinations
        Delirium
        Psychotic and violent behavior
        Barbiturates, benzodiazepines and hypnotics

        Barbiturates, benzodiazepines and hypnotics are prescription central nervous system depressants. They're often
        used and misused in search for a sense of relaxation or a desire to "switch off" or forget stress-related
        thoughts or feelings.

        Barbiturates. An example is phenobarbital.
        Benzodiazepines. Examples include sedatives, such as diazepam (Valium), alprazolam (Xanax), lorazepam (Ativan),
        clonazepam (Klonopin) and chlordiazepoxide (Librium).
        Hypnotics. Examples include prescription sleeping medicines such as zolpidem (Ambien) and zaleplon (Sonata).
        Signs and symptoms of recent use can include:

        Drowsiness
        Slurred speech
        Lack of coordination
        Irritability or changes in mood
        Problems concentrating or thinking clearly
        Memory problems
        Involuntary eye movements
        Lack of inhibition
        Slowed breathing and reduced blood pressure
        Falls or accidents
        Dizziness
        Meth, cocaine and other stimulants

        Stimulants include amphetamines, meth (methamphetamine), cocaine, methylphenidate (Ritalin, Concerta, others)
        and amphetamine-dextroamphetamine (Adderall XR, Mydayis). They're often used and misused in search of a "high,"
        or to boost energy, to improve performance at work or school, or to lose weight or control appetite.

        Signs and symptoms of recent use can include:

        Feeling of happy excitement and too much confidence
        Increased alertness
        Increased energy and restlessness
        Behavior changes or aggression
        Rapid or rambling speech
        Larger than usual pupils, the black circles in the middle of the eyes
        Confusion, delusions and hallucinations
        Irritability, anxiety or paranoia
        Changes in heart rate, blood pressure and body temperature
        Nausea or vomiting with weight loss
        Poor judgment
        Nasal congestion and damage to the mucous membrane of the nose (if snorting drugs)
        Mouth sores, gum disease and tooth decay from smoking drugs ("meth mouth")
        Insomnia
        Depression as the drug wears off
        Club drugs

        Club drugs are commonly used at clubs, concerts and parties. Examples include methylenedioxymethamphetamine,
        also called MDMA, ecstasy or molly, and gamma-hydroxybutyric acid, known as GHB. Other examples include ketamine
        and flunitrazepam or Rohypnol ― a brand used outside the U.S. ― also called roofie. These drugs are not all in
        the same category, but they share some similar effects and dangers, including long-term harmful effects.

        Because GHB and flunitrazepam can cause sedation, muscle relaxation, confusion and memory loss, the potential
        for sexual misconduct or sexual assault is associated with the use of these drugs.

        Signs and symptoms of use of club drugs can include:

        Hallucinations
        Paranoia
        Larger than usual pupils
        Chills and sweating
        Involuntary shaking (tremors)
        Behavior changes
        Muscle cramping and teeth clenching
        Muscle relaxation, poor coordination or problems moving
        Reduced inhibitions
        Heightened or altered sense of sight, sound and taste
        Poor judgment
        Memory problems or loss of memory
        Reduced consciousness
        Increased or decreased heart rate and blood pressure
        Hallucinogens

        Use of hallucinogens can produce different signs and symptoms, depending on the drug. The most common
        hallucinogens are lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and phencyclidine (PCP).

        LSD use may cause:

        Hallucinations
        Greatly reduced perception of reality, for example, interpreting input from one of your senses as another, such
        as hearing colors
        Impulsive behavior
        Rapid shifts in emotions
        Permanent mental changes in perception
        Rapid heart rate and high blood pressure
        Tremors
        Flashbacks, a reexperience of the hallucinations — even years later
        PCP use may cause:

        A feeling of being separated from your body and surroundings
        Hallucinations
        Problems with coordination and movement
        Aggressive, possibly violent behavior
        Involuntary eye movements
        Lack of pain sensation
        Increase in blood pressure and heart rate
        Problems with thinking and memory
        Problems speaking
        Poor judgment
        Intolerance to loud noise
        Sometimes seizures or coma
        Inhalants

        Signs and symptoms of inhalant use vary, depending on the substance. Some commonly inhaled substances include
        glue, paint thinners, correction fluid, felt tip marker fluid, gasoline, cleaning fluids and household aerosol
        products. Due to the toxic nature of these substances, users may develop brain damage or sudden death.

        Signs and symptoms of use can include:

        Possessing an inhalant substance without a reasonable explanation
        Brief happy excitement
        Behaving as if drunk
        Reduced ability to keep impulses under control
        Aggressive behavior or eagerness to fight
        Dizziness
        Nausea or vomiting
        Involuntary eye movements
        Appearing under the influence of drugs, with slurred speech, slow movements and poor coordination
        Irregular heartbeats
        Tremors
        Lingering odor of inhalant material
        Rash around the nose and mouth
        Opioid painkillers

        Opioids are narcotic, painkilling drugs produced from opium or made synthetically. This class of drugs includes,
        among others, heroin, morphine, codeine, methadone, fentanyl and oxycodone.

        Sometimes called the "opioid epidemic," addiction to opioid prescription pain medicines has reached an alarming
        rate across the United States. Some people who've been using opioids over a long period of time may need
        physician-prescribed temporary or long-term drug substitution during treatment.

        Signs and symptoms of narcotic use and dependence can include:

        A sense of feeling "high"
        Reduced sense of pain
        Agitation, drowsiness or sedation
        Slurred speech
        Problems with attention and memory
        Pupils that are smaller than usual
        Lack of awareness or inattention to surrounding people and things
        Problems with coordination
        Depression
        Confusion
        Constipation
        Runny nose or nose sores (if snorting drugs)
        Needle marks (if injecting drugs)
        When to see a doctor

        If your drug use is out of control or causing problems, get help. The sooner you seek help, the greater your
        chances for a long-term recovery. Talk with your health care provider or see a mental health provider, such as a
        doctor who specializes in addiction medicine or addiction psychiatry, or a licensed alcohol and drug counselor.

        Make an appointment to see a provider if:

        You can't stop using a drug
        You continue using the drug despite the harm it causes
        Your drug use has led to unsafe behavior, such as sharing needles or unprotected sex
        You think you may be having withdrawal symptoms after stopping drug use
        If you're not ready to approach a health care provider or mental health professional, help lines or hotlines may
        be a good place to learn about treatment. You can find these lines listed on the internet or in the phone book.

        When to seek emergency help

        Seek emergency help if you or someone you know has taken a drug and:

        May have overdosed
        Shows changes in consciousness
        Has trouble breathing
        Has seizures or convulsions
        Has signs of a possible heart attack, such as chest pain or pressure
        Has any other troublesome physical or psychological reaction to use of the drug

        Signs of Addiction

        You may have one or more of these warning signs:

        An urge to use the drug every day, or many times a day
        Taking more drugs than you want to, and for longer than you thought you would
        Always having the drug with you, and buying it even if you can’t afford it
        Using drugs even if they cause you trouble at work or make you lash out at family and friends
        Spending more time alone.
        Not taking care of yourself or caring how you look
        Stealing, lying, or doing dangerous things, like driving while high or having unsafe sex
        Spending most of your time getting, using, or recovering from the effects of the drug
        Feeling sick when you try to quit

        Substance dependence is the medical term used to describe use of drugs or alcohol that continues even when
        significant problems related to their use have developed. Signs of dependence include:

        Tolerance to or need for increased amounts of the drug to get an effect

        Withdrawal symptoms that happen if you decrease or stop using the drug that you find difficult to cut down or
        quit

        Spending a lot of time to get, use, and recover from the effects of using drugs

        Withdrawal from social and recreational activities

        Continued use of the drug even though you are aware of the physical, psychological, and family or social
        problems that are caused by your ongoing drug use

        The following are the most common behaviors that mean a person is using or misusing drugs or alcohol. But each
        person may have slightly different symptoms. Symptoms may include:

        Using or drinking larger amounts or over longer periods of time than planned.

        Continually wanting or unsuccessfully trying to cut down or control use of drugs or alcohol.

        Spending a lot of time getting, using, or recovering from use of drugs or alcohol.

        Craving, or a strong desire to use drugs or alcohol.

        Ongoing drug or alcohol use that interferes with work, school, or home duties.

        Using drugs or alcohol even with continued relationship problems caused by use.

        Giving up or reducing activities because of drug or alcohol use

        Taking risks, such as sexual risks or driving under the influence.

        Continually using drugs or alcohol even though it is causing or adding to physical or psychological problems.

        Developing tolerance or the need to use more drugs or alcohol to get the same effect. Or using the same amount
        of drugs or alcohol, but without the same effect.

        Having withdrawal symptoms if not using drugs or alcohol. Or using alcohol or another drug to avoid such
        symptoms.

        The symptoms of substance use disorder may resemble other medical problems or psychiatric conditions. Always
        consult your doctor for a diagnosis.

        A family doctor, psychiatrist, or qualified mental health professional usually diagnoses substance use disorder.
        Clinical findings often depend on the substance, the frequency of use, and the length of time since last used,
        and may include:

        Weight loss

        Constant fatigue

        Red eyes

        Little concern for hygiene

        Lab abnormalities

        Unexpected abnormalities in heart rate or blood pressure

        Depression, anxiety, or sleep problems

        Harmful drug use occurs when a person repeatedly uses the drug in a way that can cause significant impairment,
        including:
        Sickness
        Disability
        Loss of self-control
        Ignoring responsibilities
        Social problems
