        Identifying signs of drug addiction & use can be challenging, but early recognition is crucial to prevent
        long-term harm. Some signs of drug addiction include regularly using the drug, intense cravings, increasing drug
        use over time, taking larger doses than intended, ensuring a steady supply, spending money despite financial
        difficulties, neglecting work or social responsibilities, continuing to use despite problems, engaging in risky
        behaviors, spending a significant amount of time on the drug, failing to stop despite attempts to quit, and
        experiencing withdrawal symptoms.

        euphoria, increased heart rate, dry mouth & decreased coordination, while K2 or bath salts can cause extreme
        anxiety or agitation, hallucinations & violent behavior.

        developing a tolerance & experiencing withdrawal symptoms.
